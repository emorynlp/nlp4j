<!--
                    dtd for predicate argument lexicon files

 Each file will contain a set of predicates associated with a particular
 lemma (including phrasal variants,  like 'keep_from', etc)

 Each predicate will contain a set of roles in an entity called a roleset.  The
 rolesets give mneumonics of the argument labels for each different set of
 arguments.  Multiple rolesets per predicate are necessary for the accomodation
 of different senses of the predicate.

 Each roleset associates the argument labels with a set of examples
 demonstrating some of the primary considerations in predicate argument
 annotation for the predicate+roleset in consideration.  The examples contain
 plain text sentences and then assign arguments to segments of the sentence.
 The examples usually have names which are often space delimited descriptions
 of the annotation.  The examples often have types which describe, in a
 nutshell, some primary linguistic properties such as "benefactive" or
 "agentive".  The type attribute may also include a phrasal particle variant
 (eg type="keep pace") so as to indicate the guidelines for annotation of these
 cases.

 The entire document can be decorated with notes for unstructured description of
 the information presented.

  The roleset's levine class attribute takes the following form:

  -|\d+(\.\d+)*( \d+(\.\d+)*)*

  where '-' means there is no levine class
  and something like 47.2 means 47.2 is a levine class of this
  roleset.  The list of levine classes is space delimited

  roles have a number (or an "M" associated
  with them, for common adjuncts that don't qualify for number argument status). 
  Both numbered arguments and adjuncts are labeled with the function tags from the list below:

    EXT  extent
    LOC  location
    DIR  direction
    NEG  negation  (not in PREDITOR)
    MOD  general modification
    ADV  adverbial modification
